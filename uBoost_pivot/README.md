When discussing "Learning to Pivot with Adversarial Networks," arXiv:1611.01046
in the IML meeting, it came up that the goal is not too different from "uBoost:
A boosting method for producing uniform selection efficiencies from
multivariate classifiers," arXiv:1305.7248 [nucl-ex] or "New approaches for
boosting to uniformity," arXiv:1410.4140 [hep-ex].

Yet there seem to be no direct (or well known) comparisons of the methods. We
discussed some theoretical differences / similarities / advantages /
applicabilities in the meeting back then, but it would be nice to just run a
comparison and learn from it.
